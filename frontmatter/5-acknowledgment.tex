It takes a village to raise a child, imagine what it takes to guide them all the way to a PhD degree!
%
First and foremost, I am thankful for my advisor, Parasara Sridhar Duggirala, who took me on when I realized my path in graduate school was going in the wrong direction.
%
Sridhar has been a great advisor, in the best meaning of the word, helping me to get better at research, and encouraging me in my desperate moments with compassion and kindness.
%
I am also grateful for my committee, Samarjit Chakraborty, Ron Alterovitz, Missy Cummings, and Jonathan DeCastro, for their invaluable guidance and feedback.
%
I am exceedingly grateful for having great collaborators: Manish Goyal, Nathan Otterness, Tanya Amert, Charlotte Dorn, and Bineet Gosh.
%
Working with you has been a pleasure and I have learned a lot from you.
%
I have also enjoyed getting to know other students in our group including Edward Kim, Megan Stuart, and Tao Tao.
%
I am also grateful for the great staff, especially Denise Kenney for her patience and kindness despite her busy workload.


My PhD journey started at UConn's math department, aiming to continue my study of reverse mathematics, but soon I realized that I had achieved my main objective: to answer my questions on the epistemology of mathematics and logic, so that I feel confident about the foundations on which I walk when working on applications.
%
My math advisor, Reed Solomon, was graciously and selflessly encouraging, helping me to do the transition to applications.
%
I have been always lucky with my advisors, and Reed is one of the sweetest of them all.
%
Again I was lucky that Sridhar joined UConn the same year and guided me through a whole new world, applications of logic in computer science.
%
UConn was instrumental in my career, building my mathematical confidence, my teaching and communication skills, and kickstarting my research experience.
%
I am very grateful for the always helpful staff of UConn's math department.
%
Hats off to Monique Roy, for she is the most helpful and caring staff I've ever known.
%
She is the queen of the math department!
%
UConn has a special place in my heart for all the great colleagues I had: Noah Hughes, Rashed Alawadi, Kyle Allaire, Peter Shewmaker, Joshua Flynn, David Nichols, Lisa Naples, Reynaldo Morillo, Nandan Tumu, Mahmoodreza Jahanseir, and Nick Cavanna, to name a few.
