\section{Modeling uncontrolled intersections}
\label{sec:modeling_uncontrolled}
Each rule is modeled with a first-order formula.
A formula is a combination of atomic formulas,
logical connectives and quantifiers.
We identify some subformulas 
that have an intuitive intended meaning
as \emph{auxiliary predicates}.
This is to simplify the expression of long formulas.

Atomic formulas represent either \emph{events} or \emph{static facts}.
The events and static facts are defined in terms of mathematical concepts,
such as shapes, curves, sets, intersection, union, collision (the first time two sets intersect), etc.
An \emph{event} is represented by a predicate with time as one of the arguments.
A \emph{static fact} is represented by a predicate without time as an argument.

We use Herbrand semantics to interpret the formulas \cite{Herbrand.2019}.
A traffic scenario is described by
a finite collection of ground atomic formulas which
represent static facts and events.
Therefor, traffic rules are grounded on traffic scenarios.
This choice of semantics provides
a more intuitive interpretation (than a Tarskian semantics.)
Furthermore,
implementation becomes straightforward using Answer Set Programming.

In modeling traffic rules,
we avoid using function symbols.
Therefore,
each Herbrand model (of some traffic rules and a traffic scenario) is finite.
For example,
the domain of a quantifier on a time variable $T$ is
the set of all timestamps observed in the traffic scenario.
