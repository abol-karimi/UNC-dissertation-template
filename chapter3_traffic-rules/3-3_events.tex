\subsection{Events}

%-------------------------------
\subsubsection{Time stamp}
A \emph{time stamp} is a numerical representation of the global clock.
In real time,
one event may strictly precede another but the time difference be imperceptible to humans.
Hence, it is reasonable to assume that
real time events that are closer (in time) than a threshold,
happened at the same time.
Therefore, we adopt a discrete view of time.
That is, a timestamp is simply the number of time steps since the beginning of a scenario.
The length of a time step is a hyperparameter to our model.
%-------------------------------
\subsubsection{Arrival event}
The predicate $arrivedAtForkAtTime(V, F, T)$ represents
the event of vehicle $V$ arriving at the intersection
from fork $F$ at time $T$.
The \emph{arrival time} is when the vehicle intersects with the \emph{arrival box}.
%-------------------------------
\subsubsection{Turn signal event}
The predicate $signaledAtForkAtTime(V, S, F, T)$ represents
the event of vehicle $V$ using turn signal $S$
when it arrives at fork $F$ at time $T$.
%----------------------
\subsubsection{Entrance event}
The predicate $enteredForkAtTime(V, F, T)$ represents
the event of vehicle $V$ entering (branches of) fork $F$ at time $T$.
An \emph{entrance box} represents
the border between the incoming lane and the branches of $F$.
%----------------------
\subsubsection{Lane leave event}
The predicate $leftLaneAtTime(V, L, T)$ represents
the event of vehicle $V$ leaving lane $L$ completely at time $T$.
That is,
at time $T$,
intersection of $V$ and $L$ transitions from nonempty to empty.
%----------------------
\subsubsection{Exit event}
The predicate $ exitedFromAtTime(V, E, T) $ represents the event of
vehicle $V$ leaving the intersection
from the \emph{exit} $E$
at time $T$.
The time $T$ is when the vehicle's body stops intersecting
the exit $E$'s extent box.
The \emph{extent box} is simply a box-shaped subset of the 3D space.
