\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evalsetup}

We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach by generating test-cases for three different situations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item left turn at a multi-lane 4-way stop,
\item left turn at a T-intersection from the continuing highway to the terminating highway,
\item left turn at a 3-way uncontrolled Y-intersection.
\end{enumerate}
%
For each of these static environments, we generate a sequence of increasingly complex test-cases.
%
The videos and logs of the test-cases, also the traffic rules' encoding in Clingo \cite{Gebser.2018}, are available on the web\footnote{\url{https://www.dropbox.com/sh/e6q4hw98ert5yj7/AAAgo7IlYRKg-rYs7Q9GyMx9a?dl=0}}.
%
The solvability and complexity certificates are visualized in the videos with green and red egos, respectively.


%---executing test-cases
CARLA has several built-in autopilot software that have access to the full simulation state.
%
We subject two specific autopilot agents to the test suite which are automatically generated by our algorithm.
%
We observe that autopilot can fail as we increase the complexity of the test-cases.
%
Finally, we test CARLA's autopilot when  Intel's Responsibility Sensitive Safety (RSS) is added to safeguard autopilot's actions.
%
We observe fewer failures when RSS is enabled, but still autopilot-plus-RSS doesn't pass all the test-cases.


%---the challenge of solving the problem
Our straightforward attempt using Scenic's probabilistic programming failed to find solutions to the search problem.
%
The search space is uncountably infinite so there are too many ways to modify a failed sample.
%
On the other hand, the solution space is highly restricted with continuous and discrete constraints and intertwined dependencies, as explained in the previous section.
%
More specifically, traffic rules depend on only a few discrete events, so they partition the search space into big equivalence classes.
%
Probabilistic mutation of trajectories is searching for a target class by walking within big classes and looking for their boundaries.
%
In contrast, our ASP approach is identifying all the target classes by looking from the above, then searching for a sample within each of them.
