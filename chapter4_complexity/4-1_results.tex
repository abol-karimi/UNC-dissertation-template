\subsection{Results}
We use Scenic \cite{Fremont.2023} as an interface to CARLA to execute a generated test-case, e.g. to test CARLA's autopilot (playing the role of ego).

\textbf{Four-way Stop:} The first example demonstrates making incrementally more complex test-cases by adding more non-egos.
%
The goal of ego is to make a left turn from a four-way stop.
%
Ego starts from the bottom side of the intersection in Figure~\ref{fig:4way} and must exit the intersection from the left side.
%
We generate three test-cases, each more complex than the previous one.
%
In the first test-case a non-ego is added that enters the intersection from the left and passes straight through the intersection.
%
In the second test-case (visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:4way}), a non-ego is added that approaches from the top, the opposite side of ego, and passes straight through the intersection.
%
In the third test-case, a non-ego is added that approaches also from the left but the other lane of the road, and passes straight through the intersection.
%
Both CARLA's autopilot and autopilot-plus-RSS pass the first test-case.
%
Autopilot fails the second test-case while autopilot-plus-RSS passes it.
%
Finally, both autopilot and autopilot-plus-RSS fail the third test-case.
%
See the videos for even more complex extensions of this test-case.

\end{figure}% <<<


\textbf{T-intersection:} The goal of ego is to perform an unprotected left turn from the continuing highway to the terminating highway of the T-intersection shown in Figure \ref{fig:continuing}.
%
Ego approaches the intersection from the right side and must make a left turn to enter the road on the bottom.
%
This example demonstrates that we can add multiple non-egos to a test-case simultaneously.
%
Starting with an empty test-case, our test-case generator adds multiple non-egos that pass straight through the intersection from left to right.
%
CARLA's autopilot fails this test-case but autopilot-plus-RSS passes it.

    \subcaption{illegal already exited from the bottom but ego waited for car1.}
  \end{minipage}%
  \caption{Unprotected left turn from an uncontrolled Y-intersection.}\label{fig:Y-intersection}%
\end{figure}% <<<


\textbf{Y-intersection:} The third example demonstrates that we can add a non-ego whose route does not conflict ego's route, as long as we add also a non-ego whose route has a conflict so that the test-case can become more complex.
%
Autopilot fails this test-case.
%
Running Autopilot-plus-RSS results in a segmentation fault which seems to be due to a bug in CARLA's map or integration of RSS.
%
Ego's goal is to approach from right and make a left turn to the bottom of the intersection.
%
The conflicting non-ego, \verb|car1|, approaches from the bottom, makes a left turn and exits from the top left corner of the intersection.
%
The non-conflicting non-ego, \verb|car2|, also approaches from the bottom, but makes a right turn and exits from the right side of the intersection.
