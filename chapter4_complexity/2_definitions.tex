\section{Test-case complexity}
\label{sec:definitions}

We follow Ulbrich et al. \cite{Ulbrich.2015} for the definitions of \emph{scene}, \emph{scenario} and \emph{test-case}.
%
We clarify their definition of a test-case by adding the terminology of a \emph{partial} scenario and \emph{execution} of a test-case.
%
Then, we propose our definition of \emph{test-case complexity}.
%
Finally, we present some of the details of our formal representations.
