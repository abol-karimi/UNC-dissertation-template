\section{Test-case Synthesis}
Given a solvable test-case (referred to as the \emph{old} test-case), the problem is to find a \emph{new} solvable test-case that is more complex.
%
We model this search problem as a constraint-satisfaction problem (CSP).
%
First we explain this search problem, then we present our search algorithm.
