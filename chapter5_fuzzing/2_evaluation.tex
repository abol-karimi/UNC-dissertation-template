\section{Evaluation}

Our goal of fuzzing for scenario generation is to generate a set of diverse test scenarios for various autonomous agents as efficiently as possible.
% 
To answer this question, the evaluation is divided into two parts.
% 
First part deals with effectiveness and efficiency of fuzzing operations.
% 
This evaluation quantifies whether fuzzing actually generates better coverage than pure random testing.
% 

The second part tries to generalize the test cases covered for one agent can be applied to another agent.
% 
Given the wide variety of ego agents, at least 10 different companies working on AV logic, it is unclear if generating fuzzing inputs for one agent would result in the same coverage for other agents.
